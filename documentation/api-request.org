Eric,

Here is an example of what information our tool requires to automatically add items
to TFS. Since our version of TFS is changing soon, it's understandable that we might
need to change things around a little bit, but for now, this is almost copying
and pasting from the parameters of the function that does the actual bug-adding:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript

{
    /* name of the folder we're adding an item to - REQUIRED
	possible options:
	- "Content QA"
	- "Functional QA"
	- "Mobile QA"
	- "Peer Review"
	- "User Acceptance Testing" */
    folderType: "Content QA",

    /* type of item we're adding to the folder - REQUIRED
	possible options:
	- "Bug"
	- "Task"
	- "Issue"
	- "Risk" */
    itemType: "Bug",

    /* tag of the course we're referring to - REQUIRED 
	Format: /\w{2}\d{2}-\d{3}/        */
    courseTag: "AD12-105",

    /* the number of the web we're referring to - REQUIRED */
    webNumber: "25",

    /* the tags to add to the new item - REQUIRED */
    tagsToAdd: ["AD12-105", "Web25-Example Tag"],

    /* the title to add to the item - REQUIRED */
    title: "AD12-105-06-01-03 - Mismatching images",

    /* the description to add to the item - REQUIRED */
    description: "The images don't match; see attachments.",

    /* attachments to add to the item - OPTIONAL */
    images: [
	{
	    comment: "old slide screenshot",
	    base64: "q0245jhskjnf902ihruhsiudfhsdf"
	},
	{
	    comment: "new slide screenshot",
	    base64: "092jnfdgjnp2lsldkmnjkn2iui24u"
	}
    ]
}
