* Quality Assurance Helper - Chrome Extension
** Introduction
The QA Helper is a tool designed to streamline the process of
performing 1:1 Validations between the old and new UTI
courseware by minimizing the ill effects of some the process's biggest pain
points. This tool was originally developed for 
supporting Content QA, but could be expanded in the future
to aid in other areas of need.
The usage of its features are the same, independent of the
page that it is running on:
1. A box with buttons will appear in the top-left corner of the page
2. This box can be dragged around to any location on the screen that is convenient for the task at hand
3. Buttons within the box can be clicked to invoke the help of the tool
** Features by Page
*** Blackboard

**** Jump to Web
NOTE: You must login to Blackboard in order for this button to work properly!
Clicking this button will present you with a dialog box 
containing two dropdown boxes and a button labeled 'Jump'.
[[file:documentation/blackboard-ui1.JPG]]
1. The Course Dropdown
- This dropdown box will contain a list of all the courses QA Helper has learned about (see NOTE below).
2. The Web Dropdown
- When a course is selected in The Course Dropdown, this dropdown box will contain a list of all the webs in the selected course that QA
Helper has learned about and can open for you.
3. The Jump button
- Click this button after you've selected the appropriate course and web, and it will open the correct web for you in Blackboard and in the DR site!
If QA Helper has not yet learned about a course, you cannot navigate to it in the dropdown menus.
*NOTE*: To teach QA Helper about a new course, navigate to the
course page in Blackboard that lists all the webs you'd like to teach
QA Helper about. As soon as any given course page has finished
loading, you should notice that the Course dropdown will then be populated
with an additional field representing that course.//

*** TFS - Board View
[[file:documentation/tfs-ui.JPG]]
**** To QA
Clicking this button will automatically scroll the screen over to
the QA section of the Kanban board.
*** New Slide
[[file:documentation/newslide-ui.JPG]]
**** Next Slide
NOTE: because QA is best done as close to the student experience as
possible, it is not recommended that this button is used while doing
actual QA work
Clicking this button will force the Web to navigate you to the next
slide, regardless of the normal constraints that are placed upon
navigation for students.
**** Run Comparison
NOTE: due to imperfections in the OCR technology that is used as the
backbone of this feature, it is considered experimental, and QA results
should not depend upon its output
NOTE: Although they are high, it is possible that this feature could
be limited due to rate limits.
Clicking this button when both a New Slide and an Old Slide are open at the 
same time in Google Chrome will trigger a visual programmatic comparison
using Optical Character Recognition technology. This means the
computer will try and read the text on the screen and then compare the results.
Text that the computer flags as "matching" will be marked in green, while text
that the computer flags as "not matching" will be marked in red. Since this tool's
accuracy entirely depends on the accuracy of the third-party OCR engine that it relies
upon, its results are not to be trusted.
**** Add Bug
Clicking this button will automatically grab the reference information from the current slide
and send it to the nearest tab that is opened to TFS's backlog view. That backlog view will
receive the information and use it to find the appropriate Content QA folder on the page and
programmatically fill out the basic template for adding a bug, complete with the appropriate tags
and initial title name.
**** Previous Slide
NOTE: since QA is best done as close to the student experience as
possible, it is not recommended that this button is used while doing
actual QA work
Clicking this button will force the Web to navigate you to the previous
slide, regardless of the normal constraints that are placed upon
navigation for students.
** Limitations
The tool sometimes causes the following problems:
1. Next button on Blackboard slides remains grayed out even after the narration is finished.
2. Answers won't scramble when user clicks "Redo" on a multiple choice question.
3. Checkmarks will not be shown next to correct answers when "Check Answers" is clicked.
4. On very rare occassions, the "Jump to Web" button on the blackboard website may navigate you to a new slide and an old slide that do not match.
5. If two old slides or two new slides are open at the same time when the text comparison is run, one of the two new or old slides will have a black box remain on it.
See Troubleshooting below for solutions to these problems.
** Troubleshooting
To overcome the limitations of the QA-Helper tool listed above, do the following (numbers are comparable):
1-3. Close out of and reopen the web you are currently doing QA for.
4. Navigate to the courses individually by clicking the proper links on the the Blackboard & Avondale sites.
5. Restart your QA-Helper tool by closing out of all pages that the QA-Helper tool set up for you and clicking on the Chrome extension again. Then retry the run comparison with only one new slide and one old slide open.
If problems persist, please contact any developers working on this tool.
** TODO
- See if there is any value in upgrading our OCR API access to an increased number of requests per month.
