* Quality Assurance Helper - Chrome Extension
** Introduction

The QA Helper is a tool designed to streamline the process of
performing 1:1 Validations between the old and new UTI
courseware by minimizing the ill effects of some its biggest pain
points. This tool was originally developed in particular for
supporting Content QA, but could be expanded upon in the future
to aid in other areas of need.

The global usage of its features remains the same, independent of the
page that it is run upon:
1. A box with buttons will appear in the top-left corner of the page
2. This box can be dragged around to any location on the screen that
   is convenient for the task at hand
3. Buttons within the box can be clicked to invoke the help of the
   tool

** Features by Page
*** Blackboard

**** Jump to Web
NOTE: in order for this button to work properly, you must ensure
that you are logged into Blackboard before using it!

Clicking this button will present you with a dialog
containing two dropdown boxes and a button labeled 'Jump'.

[[file:documentation/blackboard-ui1.JPG]]
1. The Course Dropdown
- This dropdown box will contain a list of all the courses QA Helper
  has learned about.

2. The Web Dropdown
- When a course is selected in The Course Dropdown, this dropdown box
  will contain a list of all the webs in the selected course that QA
  Helper has learned about and can open for you.

3. The Jump button
- Click this button after you've selected the appropriate course and web,
  and it will open the correct web for you in Blackboard and in the DR site!

If QA Helper has not yet learned about a course, it will be unavaiable
to navigate to in the dropdown menus.

To teach QA Helper about a new course, simply navigate to the
course page in Blackboard that lists all the webs you'd like to teach
QA Helper about. As soon as any given course page has finished
loading, you should notice that the Course dropdown will then be populated
with an additional field representing that course.
*** TFS - Board View

**** To QA
Clicking this button will automatically scroll the screen over to
center on the Kanban columns designated for the QA team.
*** New Slide
[[file:documentation/newslide-ui.JPG]]
**** Next Slide
NOTE: since QA is best done as close to the student experience as
possible, it is not recommended that this button is used while doing
actual QA work
Clicking this button will force the Web to navigate you to the next
slide, regardless of the normal constraints that are placed upon
navigation for students.
**** Run Comparison
NOTE: due to imperfections in the OCR technology that is used as the
backbone of this feature, it is considered experimental, and QA results
should not depend upon its output
NOTE: although they are very high, it is possible that this feature could
be throttled due to rate limits.

Clicking this button when both a New Slide and an Old Slide are open at the 
same time in Google Chrome will trigger a visual programmatic comparison
using Optical Character Recognition technology. This basically means the
computer will try and read the text on the screen and then compare the results.

Text that the computer flags as "matching" will be marked in green, while text
that the computer flags as "not matching" will be marked in red. Since this tool's
accuracy entirely depends on the accuracy of the third-party OCR engine that it relies
upon, its results are not to be trusted.
**** Add Bug
Clicking this button will automatically grab the reference information from the current slide
and send it to the nearest tab that is opened to TFS's backlog view. That backlog view will
receive the information and use it to find the appropriate Content QA folder on the page and
programmatically fill out the basic template for adding a bug, complete with the appropriate tags
and initial title name.
**** Previous Slide
NOTE: since QA is best done as close to the student experience as
possible, it is not recommended that this button is used while doing
actual QA work
Clicking this button will force the Web to navigate you to the previous
slide, regardless of the normal constraints that are placed upon
navigation for students.
** Limitations
** Troubleshooting




We need to see if there is any value in upgrading our OCR API access to an increased 
number of requests per month.
